# Breadboard-8-bit-simulation.
15-02-2021 .. This is part II - be welcome to view the readme from part I

https://github.com/Alectus/Z80-Breadboard-Simulation/blob/main/README.md

As mentioned in readme part I, the Simulide version this project was made with is 0.4.14.-SR4. It is possible that when you try it the Ic 74HC173 doesn't have a reset-pin and also, introduced in BB6, that the two 74LS189's in the Ram-section are missing. Than please read this help-section for how to get these Ic's in your software.

In BB5 and 9 there are txt-files with more info.
