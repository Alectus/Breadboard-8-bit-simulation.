Startposition : switch to program - clock switch open
Enter data into the Ram:

LDA15 address  0000 	Parameter	0001 1111  = 31
ADD14 address  0001 	Parameter	0010 1110   = 46
SUB13 address  0010 	Parameter	0011 1101   = 61
OUT   address  0011 	Parameter	1110 0000   = 224
HLT   address  0100     Parameter	1111 0000   = 240

Data  address  1101	Value		0001 0100   = 20
Data  address  1110	Value		0110 0001   = 97
Data  address  1111	Value		0011 0101   = 53

Don't bother to close the dipswitches or off the buttons, the 157 A or B selectors will disconnect them from the rest.
Remember, it is a Ram, when you stop Simulide this data will be lost. Pause keeps the data intact.
Press Master Reset a few times. Set switch back to Run-mode. Close the clock-generator switch.
First register A will be loaded with 53
Later register B will be loaded with 97
Alu shows sum 150
Register A loads with 20 - logic control tells to subtract this and end result is 130.
Clock stops - end of program.
Open clock switch, press master reset a few times and close clock switch, the program will strart again.

When you open the simu-file the control logic eeproms should contain program data already.
If you want to change it you can use the Nano Eeprom Programmer Completed simu-file.

The control eeproms are uploaded with this program:
